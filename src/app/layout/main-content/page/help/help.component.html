            <b>1. What is SEA?</b>
            <br/>
            In silicon target prediction is critical method in drug development, on which there is
            a substantial body of research (Peón A, Dang CC, Ballester PJ (2016) doi: 10.3389/fchem.2016.00015).
            Among these method, SEA (Chemical similarity ensemble approach) has been approved as a promising
            tool and successfully applied in drug repositioning(Keiser MJ, Setola V, Irwin JJ, et al (2010)
            doi: 10.1038/nature08506.Predicting; Keiser MJ, Roth BL, Armbruster BN, et al (2007)
            doi: 10.1038/nbt1284; Cameron RT, Coleman RG, Day JP, et al (2013) doi: 10.1016/j.bcp.2013.02.026)
            and natural products target prediction (Sá MS, de Menezes MN, Krettli AU, et al (2011)
            doi: 10.1021/np200260f). In our previous work, we proposed a multi-voting SEA model for small
            molecule target prediction (Wang Z, Liang L, Yin Z, Lin J (2016) doi: 10.1186/s13321-016-0130-x).
            Zhonghua by utilizing the multi-voting SEA model, all compounds in YaTCM can be systematically
            predicted and mapped to single protein targets from ChEMBL database. Four different molecular
            fingerprints (MACCS, Morgan, Topological and Atom pair) were used to build SEA models.

            <b>2. What is KEGG metabolic pathway mapping</b>
            <br/>
            The concept of metabolite-likeness, which derived from the fact that drugs are more
            structurally similar to endogenous metabolites than are library compounds, is a useful
            principle in drug design(Dobson PD, Patel Y, Kell DB (2009), doi: 10.1016/j.drudis.2008.10.011).
            Kim et al.( Kim HU, Ryu JY, Lee JO, Lee SY (2015) doi: 10.1038/nbt.3167) reported that the degree
            of structural similarity between compounds derived from traditional oriental medicine and human
            metabolites is even higher than that of small molecule drug and human metabolites, and mapping
            of TCM compounds to human metabolic pathway based on structural similarity may helpful in analyses
            of mechanisms of actions(Kim HU, Ryu JY, Lee JO, Lee SY (2015) doi: 10.1038/nbt.3167). Therefore,
            to make full use of ingredients data in YaTCM, all compounds were mapping to KEGG human metabolic
            pathway by calculating structural similarity of TCM-metabolite pairs. In addition, we further mapped
            therapeutic targets to KEGG human signal transduction pathways. So for one specific herb or prescription,
            we can build the pathway analysis system by this methodology. Fig 2 showed the pathway mapping result in
            prescription Yu Ping Feng. In Fig 2, corresponding compound and protein are highlighted in red point
            and blue rectangle respectively where we can click to acquire the corresponding relationship between
            YaTCM and KEGG.

            <b>3.what are Network building and analysis</b>
            <br/>
            In order to analyze different aspects of YaTCM data, we have developed a visualization interface
            by ECharts(http://echarts.baidu.com/) and Networkx(http://networkx.github.io/) from which the
            network can be displayed within webpage.

            <b>4.What is prescription explorer?</b>
            <br/>
            TCM is characterized by the wide use of herbal formulae, which are capable of systematically
            treating diseases determined by interactions among various herbs. However, the molecule
            mechanism of action remains a mystery due to the lack of appropriate methods. So from a
            network and pathways perspective, we also build prescription explorer system for one specific
            prescription. Firstly, using herb explorer method above, we acquired the common therapeutic
            targets (Fig.3-1) and diseases (Fig3-3) among any two herb shares, which were rendered as
            interactive network graph. Secondly, the herb-herb relationship were build by it shared a
            certain number of therapeutic targets located in some KEGG pathways or not (Fig.3-4) or
            herb-herb relationship by it shared a certain number of diseases (Fig 3-2). From number 4 in Fig3,
            we can get a list of common KEGG pathways, a list of shared therapeutic targets and a list of
            therapeutic targets that were appeared only in common KEGG pathways.

            YaTCM was only test on the latest version of browser, so please try the latest
            browser (google chrome , firefox, etc) if you have any display problems.
