        Users can upload a file with multiple molecules (at most 1000) stored in sdf or
        SMILES formats via “Chemical Screening” sub-menus and provide a valid e-mail address
        for receiving calculation results.  Users can click the “Submit”
        button to deliver the query molecules to  YaTCM Server. After retrieving the users’
        job successfully, the calculation starts on the backend server of YaTCM. A typical
        run containing a molecule takes 2 ~ 3 min, while the run time will depend on the
        number of molecules.

            <b>1. What is SEA?</b>
            <br/>
            <!--In silicon target prediction is critical method in drug development, on which there is-->

            <!--Among these method, SEA (Chemical similarity ensemble approach) has been approved as a promising-->
            <!--tool and successfully applied in drug repositioning(Keiser MJ, Setola V, Irwin JJ, et al (2010)-->

            In silico target prediction is critical for drug discovery and development, on which there is a
            substantial body of research (Ballester PJ, Frontiers in Chemistry, 4, 2016, 1-10). One such
            method—SEA—has proved to be a promising tool and has been successfully applied in drug repositioning
            (Keiser MJ, Nature, 462, 2009, 175-181; Keiser MJ, Nature Biotechnology, 25, 2007, 197-206; Cameron R.T.
            et al. Biochemical Pharmacology 85, 2013, 1297–1305) and natural products target prediction (Sá MS, Journal
            of Natural Products, 74, 2011, 2269-2272). In our previous work, we proposed a multi-voting SEA model
            for small molecule target prediction (Wang Z, Journal of Cheminformatics, 8, 2016, 20). By utilizing
            the multi-voting SEA model, all compounds in YaTCM can be systematically predicted and mapped to single
            protein targets from the ChEMBL database. Four different molecular fingerprints (MACCS, Morgan, Topological
            and Atom pair) were used to build SEA models.

            <b>2. What is KEGG metabolic pathway mapping?</b>
            <br/>
            <!--The concept of metabolite-likeness, which derived from the fact that drugs are more-->
            <!--structurally similar to endogenous metabolites than are library compounds, is a useful-->

            <!--Kim et al.( Kim HU, Ryu JY, Lee JO, Lee SY (2015) doi: 10.1038/nbt.3167) reported that the degree-->

            <!--metabolites is even higher than that of small molecule drug and human metabolites, and mapping-->
            <!--of TCM compounds to human metabolic pathway based on structural similarity may helpful in analyses-->
            <!--of mechanisms of actions(Kim HU, Ryu JY, Lee JO, Lee SY (2015) doi: 10.1038/nbt.3167). Therefore,-->
            <!--to make full use of ingredients data in YaTCM, all compounds were mapping to KEGG human metabolic-->
            <!--pathway by calculating structural similarity of TCM-metabolite pairs. In addition, we further mapped-->
            <!--therapeutic targets to KEGG human signal transduction pathways. So for one specific herb or prescription,-->
            <!--we can build the pathway analysis system by this methodology. Fig 2 showed the pathway mapping result in-->
            <!--prescription Yu Ping Feng. In Fig 2, corresponding compound and protein are highlighted in red point-->
            <!--and blue rectangle respectively where we can click to acquire the corresponding relationship between-->
            <!--YaTCM and KEGG.-->
            The concept of metabolite-likeness, which is derived from the fact that drugs are more structurally
            similar to endogenous metabolites than library compounds, is a useful principle in drug design
            (Drug Discovery Today, Volume 14, Numbers 1/2, January 2009). Kim et al. (Kim HU, Nature Biotechnology,
            33, 2015, 264-268) reported that the degree of structural similarity between compounds derived from
            traditional oriental medicine and human metabolites is even higher than that between small drug molecules
            and human metabolites. They argue that mapping of TCM compounds to human metabolic pathway based on
            structural similarity may be useful in analyses of mechanisms of action. Therefore, in YaTCM, all compounds
            were mapped to KEGG human metabolic pathway by calculating structural similarity of TCM-metabolite pairs.
            In addition, we further mapped therapeutic targets to KEGG human signal transduction pathways. To
            quantitatively elucidate the importance of these pathways, we further applied commonly used gene-ontology
            enrichment analysis (Nucleic Acids Research, 2009, Vol. 37, No. 1 1–13) to rank the score of these pathways.
            Figure 2 shows the pathway mapping result in prescription Yu Ping Feng. The corresponding compound and
            protein are outlined by a red circle and a blue rectangle, respectively. It is possible to click on these
            objects to acquire the corresponding relationship between YaTCM and KEGG.

            <b>3.what are Network building and analysis?</b>
            <br/>
            <!--In order to analyze different aspects of YaTCM data, we have developed a visualization interface-->
            <!--by ECharts(http://echarts.baidu.com/) and Networkx(http://networkx.github.io/) from which the-->
            <!--network can be displayed within webpage.-->
            To visualize and graphically analyze the relationship of the different aspects of YaTCM data,
            we developed a visualization interface using <a href="http://echarts.baidu.com/" target="_blank">ECharts</a>
            and <a href="http://networkx.github.io/" target="_blank">NetworkX</a>,
            allowing the information of the interactive network to be displayed
            within a webpage. The network button on the result page can be used to render a ‘Force’ dynamic
            network graph or ‘Circle’ static network graph. Users can filter superabundant no-drug molecular
            nodes and links through setting four vital ADMET parameters and Tao’s drug-likeness parameter
            (W. Tao et al. Journal of Ethnopharmacology, 145, 2013, 1–10). The four ADMET parameters, include
            stars (default value is 0~4), QPlogBB (default is -3.0~1.2), RuleOfFive (default is 0~4),
            PercentHumanOralAbsorption (default is 0.0~100.0) (see Table S3 in Supporting information). The
            default value of drug-likeness parameter is > 0.18. Networks can be exported in Portable Network
            Graphic (PNG) format.

            <b>4.What is prescription explorer?</b>
            <br/>
            <!--TCM is characterized by the wide use of herbal formulae, which are capable of systematically-->
            <!--treating diseases determined by interactions among various herbs. However, the molecule-->
            <!--mechanism of action remains a mystery due to the lack of appropriate methods. So from a-->
            <!--network and pathways perspective, we also build prescription explorer system for one specific-->
            <!--prescription. Firstly, using herb explorer method above, we acquired the common therapeutic-->
            <!--targets (Fig.3-1) and diseases (Fig3-3) among any two herb shares, which were rendered as-->
            <!--interactive network graph. Secondly, the herb-herb relationship were build by it shared a-->
            <!--certain number of therapeutic targets located in some KEGG pathways or not (Fig.3-4) or-->
            <!--herb-herb relationship by it shared a certain number of diseases (Fig 3-2). From number 4 in Fig3,-->
            <!--we can get a list of common KEGG pathways, a list of shared therapeutic targets and a list of-->
            <!--therapeutic targets that were appeared only in common KEGG pathways.-->
            When treating diseases using TCM, a prescription or herbal formula containing various herbs is usually
            applied. To better understand the molecular mechanism of action of TCM prescription or herbal formulas,
            YaTCM can explore a TCM prescription or herbal formulas from a network and pathways perspective. Firstly,
            the common therapeutic targets (Figure A) and diseases (Figure C) between any two herbs are identified and
            rendered as an interactive network graph. Secondly, the herb-herb interacting pairs were constructed based
            on a certain number of common therapeutic targets, which are ether involved in the same KEGG pathway
            (Figure D) or share a certain number of diseases (Figure B). Clicking the edge between two nodes reveals
            three links, a list of common KEGG pathways (Figure D,2), a list of shared therapeutic targets (Figure D,1)
            and a list of therapeutic targets that appeared only in the common KEGG pathway (Figure D,3).
