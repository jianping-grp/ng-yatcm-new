            <b>1. What is SEA?</b>
            <br/>
            SEA (Chemical similarity ensemble approach) has been approved as a promising tool
            and successfully applied in drug repositioning and natural products target prediction.
            In our previous work, we proposed a multi-voting SEA model for small molecule target
            prediction. Zhonghua by utilizing the multi-voting SEA model, all compounds in YaTCM
            can be systematically predicted and mapped to single protein targets from ChEMBL database.
            Four different molecular fingerprints (MACCS, Morgan, Topological and Atom pair) were used
            to build SEA models.

            <b>2. KEGG metabolic pathway mapping</b>
            <br/>
            The concept of metabolite-likeness, which derived from the fact that drugs are more
            structurally similar to endogenous metabolites than are library compounds, is a useful
            principle in drug design[51]. Kim et al.[4] reported that the degree of structural
            similarity between compounds derived from traditional oriental medicine and human metabolites
            is even higher than that of small molecule drug and human metabolites, and mapping of TCM
            compounds to human metabolic pathway based on structural similarity may helpful in analyses of
            mechanisms of actions[4]. Therefore, to make full use of ingredients data in YaTCM, all compounds
            were mapping to KEGG human metabolic pathway by calculating structural similarity of TCM-metabolite
            pairs.

            <b>3. Network building and analysis</b>
            <br/>
            In order to analyze different aspects of YaTCM data, we have developed a visualization interface
            by ECharts(http://echarts.baidu.com/) and Networkx(http://networkx.github.io/) from which the
            network can be displayed within webpage.

            <b>4.What is herb explorer?</b>
            <br/>
            Hu et al[52] apply a simple definition that two targets are related to each other if they
            share at least five active compounds. In our previous work, PhIN[53] database defined
            target-target interaction pairs in terms of shared compounds or shared scaffolds. As an
            analogy of this methodology, in YaTCM, to explorer the mechanism of action of herbs, one
            of two simple criteria, herb-target-herb criteria or herb-disease-herb, is used to defined
            an interacting herb pairs. Two herbs are defined as the same effect if they share a certain
            number of therapeutic targets or diseases. To give the user a global view of herb-*-herb interaction
            in database and conduct large-scale analysis, we also employ network visualization technology
            to display the network in herbsâ€™ detail pages where uses can choose the number of shared targets
            or diseases according the cursor.

            <b>5.What is prescription explorer?</b>
            <br/>
            TCM is characterized by the wide use of herbal formulae, which are capable of systematically
            treating diseases determined by interactions among various herbs. However, the molecule mechanism
            of action remains a mystery due to the lack of appropriate methods. So from a network and pathways
            prespective, we also build prescription explorer system.

            YaTCM was only test on the latest version of browser, so please try the latest
            browser (google chrome , firefox, etc) if you have any display problems.
